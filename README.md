## Project Overview

This repository contains various cryptographic projects I've developed using Python. The projects cover a range of cryptographic techniques and algorithms, including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and more. Each project aims to demonstrate practical implementations of cryptographic concepts.

## Featured Projects

### Symmetric Encryption
Demonstrates the use of AES-256 for symmetric encryption and decryption.

### Asymmetric Encryption**
Implements RSA encryption and decryption using Python's built-in cryptography module.

### Hashing
Shows examples of SHA-256 and MD5 hashing for data integrity.

### Digital Signatures
Creates and verifies digital signatures using ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).

### Secure Communication**
Simulates secure communication between clients and servers using TLS/SSL.

## All Projects

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| symmetric_encryption.py | AES-256 encryption/decryption example |
| asymmetric_encryption.py | RSA encryption/decryption implementation |
| hashing.py | SHA-256 and MD5 hashing examples |
| digital_signatures.py | ECDSA digital signature creation and verification |
| secure_communication.py | Simulated secure client-server communication |

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/SegawaAbdul/Python_Reloaded.git
  Note: Some projects may require additional setup or dependencies. Please refer to the README.md file in each project's directory for specific instructions.


2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd SegawaAbdul/Python_Reloaded


3. Install dependencies (if any):
  pip install cryptography

## Documentation

Each project includes comprehensive documentation within its directory. Please refer to the README.md file in each project folder for detailed information on usage, dependencies, and implementation details.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to fork and pull request if you'd like to contribute to any of the projects.
